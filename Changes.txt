 - Added a counting mechanism, so that SNPMeta moves on if it can't fetch
   GenBank records, for some reason.
 - Added a routine to split the GenBank IDs into smaller lists, so that we
   can avoid a 414 (Request string too long) error.

 - Fixed the way SNPMeta looks for SNPs and XML records to annotate
   when the -d and --no-blast options are given.
