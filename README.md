# SNPMeta
SNPMeta is a tool to generate "metadata" for single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for easy filtering, or submission to SNP databases. Information reported
includes gene name, whether the SNP is coding or noncoding, and whether the SNP
is synonymous or nonsynonymous. SNPMeta outputs in either a [dbSNP](
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) submission report format, for a tab-delimited
format.

Example SNPs are from *Drosophila melanogaster*, identified in
[King et al. 2012](http://www.genetics.org/content/191/3/935.long). Example
output for the verbose and [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/)
formats are also provided in the `Example_Data/` directory.
