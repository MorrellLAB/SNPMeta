SNPMeta is a Python and BioPython-based tool to generate "metadata" for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for easy filtering, or submission to SNP databases. Information reported includes gene name, whether the SNP is coding or noncoding, and whether the SNP is synonymous or nonsynonymous. SNPMeta outputs in either a dbSNP submission report format, or a tab-delimited format. 

A complete manual for SNPMeta is available in SNPMeta_Manual_v1.pdf. Also see the link below for some related scripts.
